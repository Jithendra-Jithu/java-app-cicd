## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Track and continuously improve software delivery performance by measuring 4 key DevOps KPIs.

---

## 1. Deployment Frequency

- **Definition**: How often code is deployed to production.
- **Current Baseline**: 1â€“2 times per week
- **Target**: â‰¥ 3 deployments/week
- **Tracking Method**: Azure Pipelines run history + Release timeline

---

## 2. Lead Time for Changes

- **Definition**: Time from commit â†’ successful production deployment.
- **Current Baseline**: ~3 hours
- **Target**: â‰¤ 1 hour
- **Tracking Method**: Pull Request time â†’ release time in Azure DevOps

---

## 3. Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)

- **Definition**: Average time to recover from a production incident.
- **Current Baseline**: ~2 hours
- **Target**: < 1 hour
- **Tracking Method**: Azure Monitor + Incident logs

---

## 4. Change Failure Rate

- **Definition**: % of deployments causing failures/rollbacks.
- **Current Baseline**: ~20%
- **Target**: < 15%
- **Tracking Method**: Track failed pipelines + manual incident tagging
